                    You strive to do great things, and let's say you accomplish that. You do it, so much so, that victory becomes the standard. This makes victory, not a cause for celebration, but the minimum level of acceptable performance. Anything less becomes unsatisfactory, and is deemed a failure. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Congratulations. You may become very successful. You might also become very miserable.

                    In my life, it resonates with virtually everything I do. From running to schooling to developing. I chose to put in the work not because I had a good work ethic, not because I was obliged to, but because I was competent.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The teammates I trained with got faster, and I couldn't afford to fall behind in a sport where you can't catch up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The peers I learned with grinded LeetCode day in day out, and I wasn't going to let them beat me in a technical interview.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And even the people I didn't fully know, like the LinkedIn warriors, I wasn't going to sit there and watch them have their own spotlight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The point being, YOU can't afford to fall behind, because the moment you step into the ring with lethargy you have lost the battle. Don't put yourself in a spot where you know you won't grow because it's a decision that no one can make for you, and a decision that no one can save you from.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the end, you'd only be harming yourself, and if you can't even understand that, you have bigger fish to fry brochaco.
