                    After years of chasing achievement and external validation, I started to feel like I was running without direction. I had hit goals, built projects, checked boxes, and yet, something remained missing. The <em>why</em> behind all the <em>what</em>> had blurred into obscurity somewhere along the way. Aroudn that time, I picked up <em>Ikigai: The Japenese Secret to a Long and Happy Life</em> by Fransesc Miralies and Héctor García.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I don't think words printed on a page have ever resonated with me as deeply as it did. Initially, I believed it to be just another lightweight "find-your-purpose" self-help book, but instead, it felt like a mirror, showing me where my drive came from and where it had gone off track.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Ikigai, roughly translating to "reason for being," is the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. It's a relatively small word that encapsulates a big truth: that meaning doesn't come from success itself, but from the balance between passion, skill, and service. You can't fake it, and you can't force it. It's not about constant productivity or climbing some imaginary ladder. It's about alignment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And right here is where it got personal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For so long, I equated motion with progress. If I was training harder, coding longer, or learning at a faster rate, I assumed I was moving toward something worthwhile. But looking back, a lot of that effort came from fear of losing the edge, fear of being outpaced, fear of no longer being "that guy." I wasn't driven by curiosity, but by comparison.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em>Ikigai</em> flipped that perspective. It made me question not just what I was doing, but why I was doing it. Was I coding because I loved building things that could help others, or was I just trying to prove I could keep up with my peers? Was I running because it brought me joy and clarity, or was I chasing times and rankings to validate my worth?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I started building projects like MyNCRep or even this portfolio, I didn’t think about competition or credibility. I built because it was fun. Because an idea sparked and I wanted to see if I could make it real. That’s <em>Ikigai</em> in motion: doing something because it fulfills you, not because it validates you. Somewhere along the way, I forgot that. Reading the book reminded me that curiosity isn’t just something that the monkey George had, but that it’s the root of purpose.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The authors talk about Okinawan centenarians who wake up every morning with a reason, whether it be to tend to the garden, to teach, or to cook for their family. Their secret isn’t some grand ambition, but rather, it’s steady meaning. And maybe that’s what I was missing. I had built with momentum, but not in a direction.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I haven't had any time to actually implement the lessons I learned just yet, but my mindset has definitely shifted. If <em>The Curse of Competence</em> taught me how dangerous it is to live for external expectations, <em>Ikigai</em> showed me the other side of the coin: that fulfillment doesn’t come from escaping the grind, but from redefining why you’re in it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Competence built the treadmill. <em>Ikigai</em> taught me how to step off, look around, and walk my own path — one that’s quieter, slower, but infinitely more alive.
