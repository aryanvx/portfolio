                    Now this is project that reaffirmed my passion in computer science. It combined my love for problem-solving with the joy of creating something tangible that could make a real difference in people's lives.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was also the most fun I've had working on a project, because this, out of the many I've done, was the one where I got to work with peers. Now just imagine, 4 dudes who all got a passion for coding coming together to build something useful. The energy was nothing less than infectious, the ideas flowed freely, and the camaraderie made every challenge packed with dopamine.
                <h3>
                    Context
                </h3>
                <p>
                    MyNCRep began as a simple idea: a platform that could help North Carolina residents understand who represents them and what resources they have access to. Civic tools are rarely elegant, rarely intuitive, and rarely built for the people who need them most. We wanted to change that, even if only slightly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now revisiting my excitement for this project, it was the kind of environment where you forget to check the time because you’re too busy following the momentum. And I mean that literally. My leasing office had this conference room on the second floor, and we would just sit there for hours on end, coding, testing, recording demos, whatever it was.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Approach
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The system itself was unpretentious.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A React frontend: clean, fast, structured for people who didn’t want to fight their way through government websites. A Node.js backend: steady and predictable, handling API requests and filtering data so users only saw what mattered.
Each piece was written with the intention of making civic information feel less like a labyrinth and more like a tool.
